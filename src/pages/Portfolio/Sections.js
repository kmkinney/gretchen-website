            description: `In this paper, I analyze the impacts of the Japanese incarceration on Topaz children in the context of the unique relationship between children and dogs. To explore these ideas, I examine Yoshiko Uchida’s historical fiction novel Journey to Topaz, which is often suggested as an effective tool to teach young students about the Japanese incarceration. I explore how Journey to Topaz represents children’s engagement with dogs to process grief, how dogs and children are both subject to euphemism of the camps, and how dogs and children at Topaz symbolize “Americanness.”`,

            description: `In this paper, I explore how Vladek’s focus on money, control, and independence creates an imbalance of power in his romantic relationships with Luica, Anja, and Mala. I examine Vladek’s motivations for continuing (or not continuing) these relationships and ways Vladek tries to maintain power and control. Finally, I analyze how Vladek ignores the perspectives and experiences of these women to create his own biased narrative of the relationships.`,
